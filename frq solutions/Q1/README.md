# 2024 FRQ solution 1
  
## This question is about
   A bird feeder which simulates either a bear or birds eating out of the feeder. When a bear is present the currentFood value becomes 0 or just decreases depending on the amount of birds.
## Struggles with this question
   Writing the bear part of the code and the probability of the bear. The code also doesnt work right, has an error somewhere which makes it not return the right value. (still not done)
## prior experiences that helped
   Past coding experience from apcsa in class 
## What I learned by doing this question 
   Not much, I'll have to use ai or something to see where I went wrong and how I can write the code for the bear.
